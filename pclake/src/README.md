This directory is based on $FABMDIR$/src/models/pclake(PCLake reference). The PCLake reference version will be the benchmark version and starting point of au-pclake$FABMDIR$/src/models/au/pclake/). This directory will be a dynamic one that will be under constant update with regular maintenance and with further development.
```
# This directory includes:
1. pclake_model_library.F90, model library for PCLake, make all the modules acce-
  -ssed by FABM.
2. abiotic_water.F90, abiotic processes and state variables in the water column.
3. abiotic_sediment.F90, abiotic processes and state variables in the sediment.
4. phytoplankton_water.F90, phytoplankton (green algae,diatom and blue-greens
   and the related processes in water column.
5. phytoplankton_sediment.F90, settled phytoplankton(green algae,diatom and blue
   -greens)and the related processes in sediment.
6. macrophytes.F90,submerged macrophytes and its related processes.
7. zooplankton.F90,zooplankton in the water column and its related processes.
8. fish.F90, juvenile white fish, adult white fish and piscivorous fish and their
   related processes in the water column.
8. zoobenthos.F90,zoobenthos and the related processes in the sediment
9. auxilary.f90, module describes resuspension, sedimentation and burial proces-
   -ses. au-pcake updated the resuspension method which is related to real time
   shear stress.
10.utility.F90, temperature functions used by different modules.

# Developement log
- removed dilution process in auxilary.F90, updated according yaml file(Fenjuan Hu: Nov.17th,2015)
- implemented atomospheric deposition process, updated according file(Fenjuan Hu: Nov.18th, 2015)
- separated fish and zooplankton in pclake_foodweb_water module(Fenjuan Hu: Jan.7th, 2016)
```
1.  File foodweb_water.F90 is replaced by zooplankton.F90,fish.F90.
2. All zooplankton state variables(sDZoo,sNZoo,sPZoo),external dependencies and rel-
  ated zooplankton processes are kept in zooplankton.F90.
3.  All fish state variables(sDFiAd,sNFiAd,sPFiAd,sDFiJv,sNFiJv,sPFiJv,sDPisc),exter-
  nal dependencies and related fish processes are kept in fish.F90.
4.  changed related variable/parameter conventions:
  ** replaced *web* by *zoo* or *fish*
  ** in zooplankton module, wDWebZoo, wNWebZoo and wPWebZoo are replaced by wDZoo
     wNZoo and wPZoo
  ** in fish moudle,
     wDWebFiJv,tDWebFiJv,wNWebFiJv,tNWebFiJv,wPWebFiJv,tPWebFiJv
     wDWebFiAd,tDWebFiAd,wNWebFiAd,tNWebFiAd,wPWebFiAd,tPWebFiAd,wDWebPisc,
     tDWebPisc,wNWebPisc,tNWebPisc,wPWebPisc,tPWebPisc
     are replaced by
     wDFiJv,tDFiJv,wNFiJv,tNFiJv,wPFiJv,tPFiJv
     wDFiAd,tDFiAd,wNFiAd,tNFiAd,wPFiAd,tPFiAd,wDPisc,
     tDPisc,wNPisc,tNPisc,wPPisc,tPPisc
```
- changed foodweb_sediment to zoobenthos module:(Fenjuan Hu: Mar. 2nd, 2016)
```
** replaced *web* by *ben*
```
- Implemented fish manipulation process(Fenjuan Hu: Mar. 20th, 2016)
```
register fish maninpulation rate as a state variable and then can be input as time series file. Fish manipulation can be turned on and off, the according yaml file is updated.
```
- implemented modular fluexes diagnostics(Fenjuan HU: Apr. 20th, 2016)
```
modular fluxes: the total change of a state variable from the whole module. For example, sNH4W can be changed in module abiotic_water, abiotic_sediment, phytoplankton_water, zooplankton, fish and auxilary. Each modules total comtribution is called modular fluxes for sNH4W.
