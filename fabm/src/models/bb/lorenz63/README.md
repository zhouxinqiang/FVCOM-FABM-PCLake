## The Lorenz 63 model

This is NOT a bio-geochemical model and is only implemented in FABM for illustrative purposes.

Further information on the Lorenz model can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).

Included is also a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) illustrating the use of FABM models via [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

In order to use the notebook FABM must have been compiled nd installed for the python driver.
