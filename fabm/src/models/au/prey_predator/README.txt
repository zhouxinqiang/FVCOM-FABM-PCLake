The prey and predator model is a simple example of biological model, in 
which one component is taken by another component. Thus the population 
of these two components is influenced by each other and its own 
community properties, such as growth rate, limited growth uptake rate 
and so on. 

In these example, we took Lotka-Volterra model and Jacob-Monod model as 
two cases.

Lotka-Volterra model is an ideal situation that the prey population is 
only influence by the predator and its own growth rate. The same case 
to predator, thus the population of the predator is only influenced by 
the amount of prey and its own growth rate. 

In Jacob-Monod model, an approaching of uptake rate of prey is 
introduced.

I did this implementation as part of my PhD and to ease my way into 
FABM.
