#
# A small recipe for merging in remotes - use Ulfs repository as example
#

cd FABM/fabm-git/

# if not already set-up start adding Ulf's repository
git remote add ulf git://git.code.sf.net/p/fabm-ug/code

# Test the remotes we have
git remote -v

# Update the remote repository
git fetch ulf

# show some info
git remote show origin
git remote show ulf

# Track a specific feature branc in Ulf's repository
git checkout --track -b age ulf/age

# Getting ready to merge - from ulf/age to master
git checkout master

# a final look at the differences
git difftool -y master..age

# --squash should be condsidered - for initial import of new models I'm in 
# favor
git merge --squash age

# update the history and push to master repository
git commit -m "added iow_age model - Graewe"
git push

# now remove the remote track branch - locally
# the owner of the remote repository is responsible for cleaning up
git branch -d age
