The procedure to build FABM depends on the host [hydrodynamic model] you want
to use it with. Please visit the wiki for instructions: http://fabm.net/wiki.

If you encounter any problems, send an e-mail to fabm-users@googlegroups.com.

Good luck, and remember to inform us of further developments for inclusion, 
exciting simulations etc.

The FABM team.
